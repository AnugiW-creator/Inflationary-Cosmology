Curvature: Mathematica is used to plot manifolds representing the structure of spacetime at different curvatures k.

Friedmann equations.nb: Mathematica notebook in which I derive the Friedmann and continuity equations using the diffgeo package. The slow-roll approximation is then applied to obtain equations for inflation. Solutions for the scalar field and potential are then found for different inflation models - single field inflation and power law inflation.

Inflation models.nb: Mathematica notebook in which the scalar field and potential are determined for more inflation models by solving the same equations derived in Friedmann equations.nb.
