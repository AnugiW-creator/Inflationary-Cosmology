Project on inflationary cosmology for Modern Computational Techniques

Curvature.nb: Mathematica is used to plot manifolds representing the structure of spacetime at different curvatures k.

Einstein's equations.nb: Friedmann and continuity equations are derived using the diffgeo package. The evolution of the scale factor is then found for each of the three periods of the Universe (radiation dominated, matter dominated and Dark Energy dominated).

Friedmann equations.nb: Upload of Mathematica notebook covering derivation of Friedmann and continuity equations and investigation of inflation models.

Inflation models.nb: Upload of Mathematica notebook in which the scalar field and potential are determined for more inflation models by solving the same equations derived in Friedmann equations.nb.
