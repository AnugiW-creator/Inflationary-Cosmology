Friedmann equations.nb: In this notebook, I derive the Friedmann and continuity equations using the diffgeo package. The slow-roll approximation is then applied to obtain equations for inflation. Solutions for the scalar field and potential are then found for different inflation models - single field inflation and power law inflation.
